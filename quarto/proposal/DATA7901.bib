  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for the automatic detection of galaxy morphology from datasets based on an image-retrieval approach. Currently, there are several classification methods proposed to detect galaxy types within an image. However, in some situations, the aim is not only to determine the type of galaxy within the queried image, but also to determine the most similar images for query image. Therefore, this paper proposes an image-retrieval method to detect the type of galaxies within an image and return with the most similar image. The proposed method consists of two stages, in the first stage, a set of features is extracted based on shape, color and texture descriptors, then a binary sine cosine algorithm selects the most relevant features. In the second stage, the similarity between the features of the queried galaxy image and the features of other galaxy images is computed. Our experiments were performed using the EFIGI catalogue, which contains about 5000 galaxies images with different types (edge-on spiral, spiral, elliptical and irregular). We demonstrate that our proposed approach has better performance compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) methods.},

These lead to use inverse models to describe thermal behavior and to evaluate the energy consumption of buildings. Their principal goal is to provide supporting evidence of enhanced energy performances and predictions. More specifically, research questions are related to building thermal modeling which is the most appropriate in a smart grid context. In this context, the models are reviewed according to three categories. The first category is based on physical and basic principle modeling (white-box). The second offers a much simpler structure which is the statistical models (black-box). The black-box is used for prediction of energy consumption and heating/ cooling demands. Finally, the third category is a hybrid method (grey-box), which uses both physical and statistical modeling techniques. In this paper, we propose a detailed review and simulation of the main thermal building models. Our comparison and simulation results demonstrate that the grey-box is the most effective model for management of buildings energy consumption.}

  abstract = {Big data has become the norm in astronomy, making it an ideal domain for computer science research. Astronomers typically classify galaxies based on their morphologies, a practice that dates back to Hubble (1936). With small datasets, classification could be performed by individuals or small teams, but the exponential growth of data from modern telescopes necessitates automated classification methods. In December 2013, Winton Capital, Galaxy Zoo, and the Kaggle team created the Galaxy Challenge, which tasked participants with developing models to classify galaxies. The Kaggle Galaxy Zoo dataset has since been widely used by researchers. This study investigates the impact of colour space transformation on classification accuracy and explores the effect of CNN architecture on this relationship. Multiple colour spaces (RGB, XYZ, LAB, etc.) and CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, Xception, etc.) are considered, utilizing pre-trained models and weights. However, as most pre-trained models are designed for natural RGB images, we examine their performance with transformed, non-natural astronomical images. We test our hypothesis by evaluating individual networks with RGB and transformed colour spaces and examining various ensemble configurations. A minimal hyperparameter search ensures optimal results. Our findings indicate that using transformed colour spaces in individual networks yields higher validation accuracy, and ensembles of networks and colour spaces further improve accuracy. This research aims to validate the utility of colour space transformation for astronomical image classification and serve as a benchmark for future studies.},

The process scheduling is characterized by several constraints: job grouping, technological interdependence, no dead time inside the same group of jobs and dynamic processing time of jobs.

  abstract = {▪ Abstract Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

  abstract = {One of the drawbacks of nonlinear black-box models is the scaling problem. A black-box model derived for a certain process scale can not be used for other process scales. To avoid this problem, the combination of white box and black box modeling techniques may be worthwhile to investigate. In this paper an approach based on the combination of white-box and black-box modeling techniques will be described. All known parts of the process will be based on first principles (physical and chemical laws) and the remaining, unknown parts will be modeled by black-box models describing unknown parts, Comparison with a pure nonlinear black-box modeling strategy shows that for the particular example the semi-physical modeling technique outperforms the straightforward nonlinear black box model.},

There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents.

However, AI developers frequently use such content without seeking permission from rightsholders, leading to calls for requirements to disclose information on the contents of AI training data. These demands have won an early success through the inclusion of such requirements in the EU's AI Act.This article argues that such transparency requirements alone cannot rescue us from the difficult question of how best to respond to the fundamental challenges generative AI poses to copyright law. This is because the impact of transparency requirements is contingent on existing copyright laws; if these do not adequately address the challenges presented by generative AI, transparency will not provide a solution. This is exemplified by the transparency requirements of the AI Act, which are explicitly designed to facilitate the enforcement of the right to opt-out of text and data mining under the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive. Because the transparency requirements do not sufficiently address the underlying flaws of this opt-out, they are unlikely to provide any meaningful improvement to the position of individual rightsholders.Transparency requirements are thus a necessary but not sufficient measure to achieve a fair and equitable balance between innovation and protection for rightsholders. Policymakers must therefore look beyond such requirements and consider further action to address the complex challenge presented to copyright law by generative AI.},

With the development of artificial intelligence technology, deep learning is a useful tool in the classification of the morphology of galaxies and significant progress has been made in this domain. However, there is still some room for improvement in terms of classification accuracy, automation, and related issues.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) is an improved version of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. It improves the performance of the ViT model by introducing a convolutional neural network (CNN). This study explores the performance of the CvT model in the area of galaxy morphology classification.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} In this work, the CvT model was applied, for the first time, in a five-class classification task of galaxy morphology. We added different types and degrees of noise to the original galaxy images to verify that the CvT model achieves good classification performance, even in galaxy images with low signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns). Then, we also validated the classification performance of the CvT model for galaxy images at different redshifts based on the low-redshift dataset GZ2 and the high-redshift dataset Galaxy Zoo CANDELS. In addition, we visualized and analyzed the classification results of the CvT model based on the t-distributed stochastic neighborhood -embedding (t-SNE) algorithm.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that (1) compared with other five-class classification models of galaxy morphology based on CNN models, the average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1\_score evaluation metrics of the CvT classification model are all higher than 98\%, which is an improvement of at least 1\% compared with those based on CNNs; (2) the classification visualization results show that different categories of galaxies are separated from each other in multi-dimensional space.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The application of the CvT model to the classification study of galaxy morphology is a novel undertaking that carries important implications for future studies.}}}}}},

  abstract = {We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as "Green Peas", first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in SDSS imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O III] 5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to {\textasciitilde}1000 A. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8.5 - 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun) with high star formation rates ({\textasciitilde}10 M\_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 {\textasciitilde} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {$<$} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

Using Freedom of Information material from over 100 agencies, this study investigates whether and how Australian public service leaders communicated with their staff about the meaning of Robodebt and the lessons to be learnt, in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. It finds more than a quarter of public servants did not receive communication from their bureaucratic leaders interpreting the crisis, in the first six months after the Royal Commission reported. When they did, some messages were dismissive, rejecting the idea that there were cultural problems in their agency, and ignoring the fundamental cause of the crisis: over-responsiveness to ministers. Other leaders, however, responded with genuine introspection and engaged with sensitive cultural issues. Organisations often fail to learn after a crisis, particularly where cultural learning is required, or where lessons must `travel' across agencies. Given the limited meaning-making undertaken by many public service leaders, the article questions whether effective post-crisis learning is likely to occur.},

  abstract = {Classifying the morphologies of galaxies is an important step in understanding their physical properties and evolutionary histories. The advent of large-scale surveys has hastened the need to develop techniques for automated morphological classification. We train and test several convolutional neural network architectures to classify the morphologies of galaxies in both a 3-class (elliptical, lenticular, spiral) and 4-class (+irregular/miscellaneous) schema with a dataset of 14034 visually-classified SDSS images. We develop a new CNN architecture that outperforms existing models in both 3 and 4-way classification, with overall classification accuracies of 83\% and 81\% respectively. We also compare the accuracies of 2-way / binary classifications between all four classes, showing that ellipticals and spirals are most easily distinguished ({$>$}98\% accuracy), while spirals and irregulars are hardest to differentiate (78\% accuracy). Through an analysis of all classified samples, we find tentative evidence that misclassifications are physically meaningful, with lenticulars misclassified as ellipticals tending to be more massive, among other trends. We further combine our binary CNN classifiers to perform a hierarchical classification of samples, obtaining comparable accuracies (81\%) to the direct 3-class CNN, but considerably worse accuracies in the 4-way case (65\%). As an additional verification, we apply our networks to a small sample of Galaxy Zoo images, obtaining accuracies of 92\%, 82\% and 77\% for the binary, 3-way and 4-way classifications respectively.},

  abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from    imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex    hull strategy.},

Usual approaches to compute them are based on the template fitting of observed spectral energy distributions (SED) and, thus, require multicolour photometry. Here, we demonstrate that, in cases of widely used optical and near-infrared (NIR) filters, K-corrections can be precisely approximated as two-dimensional low-order polynomials of only two parameters: redshift and one observed colour. With this minimalist approach, we present the polynomial fitting functions for K-corrections in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ugriz, United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Wide Field Camera YJHK, Johnson--Cousins UBVRcIc and Two Micron All Sky Survey JHKs bands for galaxies at redshifts Z \&lt; 0.5 based on empirically computed values obtained by fitting combined optical--NIR SEDs of a set of 105 galaxies constructed from SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey DR5 photometry using the Virtual Observatory. For luminous red galaxies we provide K-corrections as functions of their redshifts only. In two filters, g and r, we validate our solutions by computing K-corrections directly from SDSS DR7 spectra. We also present a K-corrections calculator, a web-based service for computing K-corrections online.},

  abstract = {Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.},

  abstract = {When analysing data from computationally expensive simulation codes or process measurements, surrogate modelling methods are firmly established as facilitators for design space exploration, sensitivity analysis, visualisation and optimisation. Kriging is a popular surrogate modelling technique for data based on deterministic computer experiments. There exist several types of Kriging, mostly differing in the type of regression function used. Recently a promising new variable selection technique was proposed to identify a regression function in the Kriging framework. In this paper this type of Kriging, i.e., blind Kriging, has been efficiently implemented in Matlab{\textregistered} and has been extended. The implementation is validated and tested on several examples to illustrate the strength and weaknesses of this new, promising modelling technique. It is shown that the performance of blind Kriging is as good as, or better than ordinary Kriging. Though, blind Kriging comes at double the computational cost with respect to ordinary Kriging.},

The dawn of the the new microelectronic devices, like CCDs has dramatically extended the amount of observed data. Large, in some cases all sky surveys emerged in almost all the wavelength ranges of the observable spectrum of electromagnetic waves. This large amount of data has to be organized, published electronically and a new style of data retrieval is essential to exploit all the hidden information in the multiwavelength data. Many statistical algorithms required for these tasks run reasonably fast when using small sets of in-memory data, but take noticeable performance hits when operating on large databases that do not fit into memory. We utilize new software technologies to develop and evaluate fast multidimensional indexing schemes that inherently follow the underlying, highly non-uniform distribution of the data: they are layered uniform indices, hierarchical binary space partitioning, and sampled flat Voronoi tessellation of the data. These techniques can dramatically speed up operations such as finding similar objects by example, classifying objects or comparing extensive simulation sets with observations.

  abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ``ImageNet'', a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500--1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

In 1948, under the impetus of George Gamow, Robert Hermann, Ralph Alpher, and Hans Bethe in particular, relativistic cosmology entered the second phase of its history. In this phase, physical processes, in particular, nuclear and atomic processes, are taken into account. This provides two observational tests of the model: primordial nucleosynthesis, which explains the origin of light nuclei, and the existence of the cosmic microwave background, and it establishes the fact that the universe has a thermal history. Study of the large-scale structure of the universe then indicates the existence of dark matter and a nonzero cosmological constant. This model, known as the {$\Lambda$}CDM model, is the standard model of contemporary cosmology.},

The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 micorons) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

Their average ratio M\_\{halo\}/M\_\{stars\} has a minimum of about 30 for galaxies with stellar masses near that of the Milky Way (approximately 5x10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} solar masses) and increases both towards lower masses and towards higher masses. The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies. Here we report the radial velocities of ten luminous globular-cluster-like objects in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2, which has a stellar mass of approximately 2x10{\textasciicircum}8 solar masses. We infer that its velocity dispersion is less than 10.5 kilometers per second with 90 per cent confidence, and we determine from this that its total mass within a radius of 7.6 kiloparsecs is less than 3.4x10{\textasciicircum}8 solar masses. This implies that the ratio M\_\{halo\}/M\_\{stars\} is of order unity (and consistent with zero), a factor of at least 400 lower than expected. NGC1052-DF2 demonstrates that dark matter is not always coupled with baryonic matter on galactic scales.},

  abstract = {Currently, new concepts for power generation are discussed, as a response to combat global warming due to CO2 emissions stemming from the combustion of fossil fuels. These concepts include new, low-carbon fuels as well as centralized and decentralized solutions. Thus, a more diverse range of fuel supplies will be used, with (biogenic) low-caloric gases such as syngas and coke oven gas (COG) among them. Typical for theses low-caloric gases is the amount of hydrogen, with a share of 50\% and even higher. However, hydrogen mixtures have a higher reactivity than natural gas (NG) mixtures, burned mostly in today's gas turbine combustors. Therefore, in the present work, a combined experimental and modeling study of nitrogen-enriched hydrogen-air mixtures, some of them with a share of methane, to be representative for COG, will be discussed focusing on laminar flame speed data Su as one of the major combustion properties. Measurements were performed in a burner test rig at ambient pressure and at a preheat temperature T0 of 373 K. Flames were stabilized at fuel-air ratios between about {$\varphi$} = 0.5--2.1, depending on the specific fuel-air mixture. This database was used for the validation of four chemical kinetic reaction models, including an in-house one, and by referring to hydrogen-enriched natural gas mixtures. The measured laminar flame speed data of nitrogen-enriched methane-hydrogen-air mixtures are much smaller than the ones of nitrogen-enriched hydrogen-air mixtures. The grade of agreement between measured and predicted data depends on the type of flames and the type of reaction model as well as of the fuel-air ratio: good agreement was found in the fuel lean and slightly fuel rich regime; a large underprediction of the measured data exists at very fuel-rich ratios ({$\varphi$} {\textquestiondown} 1.4). From the results of the present work, it is obvious that further investigations should focus on highly nitrogen-enriched methane-air mixtures, in particular for very high fuel-air ratio ({$\varphi$} {\textquestiondown} 1.4). This knowledge will contribute to a more efficient and a more reliable use of low-caloric gases for power generation.Copyright {\copyright} 2015 by ASME},

The system considered includes an integrated steelmaking plant with conventional or novel ironmaking technologies with top gas recycling and CO2 stripping, a CHP plant and a methanol plant. Oil, natural gas and biomass are considered as both auxiliary reducing agents in the blast furnace and also as fuel in the polygeneration system. The results illustrate that an integration of steelmaking with a polygeneration system will increase the total energy efficiency and decrease the emissions of the system. It is demonstrated that certain combination of new technologies and alternative fuels yield scenarios with strongly reduced emissions, indicating a path to sustainable development in steelmaking.},

It concerned the nature of so-called spiral nebulae and the size of the Universe. Shapley believed that these nebulae were relatively small and lay within the outskirts of the Milky Way galaxy (then thought to be the center or entirety of the universe), while Curtis held that they were in fact independent galaxies, implying that they were exceedingly large and distant. A year later the two sides of the debate were presented and expanded on in independent technical papers under the title "The Scale of the Universe".  In the aftermath of the public debate, scientists have been able to verify individual pieces of evidence from both astronomers, but on the main point of the existence of other galaxies, Curtis has been proven correct.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

It is necessary to deploy renewable energy sources in the best possible way such that cost is minimized and generation is maximized. In this paper, we present a review of different optimization methods for deployment and operation of renewable energy sources based generating units. Unlike other existing reviews, we carry out a general review of this research area, without limiting ourselves to any particular issue or geographic location. We examine this area with respect to different types of renewable energy sources, different modes of operations, types of objective functions for optimization and different geographical areas from which research publication are emanating. We present a general resource allocation problem and specify different possibilities for input, output, objective function and constraints. In addition, we review different objectives used in defining the optimization problems. We also present different types of linear and non-linear optimization algorithms used in renewable energy sources. Finally, we review optimization techniques for applications with respect to different end users.}

  abstract = {In this paper, the operational planning problem for utility systems is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). For multiperiod operation with piecewise constant varying demands for utilities, the optimal choice of units for each period is determined. The objective function accounts for both the operating costs for each period and changeover costs for startup/shutdown of units each between periods of operation. A two-stage approach is proposed that requires the solution of MILP subproblems coupled with a shortest path algorithm, resulting in orders of magnitude reduction in computation time as compared to a direct MILP solution using branch and bound enumeration. The computational requirements of the algorithm are linear with respect to the number of periods and global solution of the MILP is guaranteed. Solution of three sample problems yield savings up to 5\% in total annual cost of operation with the main advantage being the simplicity of the proposed plan (few startups and shutdowns).},

  abstract = {We present the first study of the isotropy of the all-sky distribution of morphological types of galaxies in the Local Universe out to around 200 Mpc using more than 60 000 galaxies from the HyperLeda database. We use a hemispherical comparison method where the sky is divided into two opposite hemispheres and the abundance distribution of the morphological types, \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}, are compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. By pointing the axis of symmetry of the hemisphere pairs to different directions in the sky, the KS statistic as a function of sky coordinates is obtained. For three samples of galaxies within around 100, 150, and 200 Mpc, we find a significant hemispherical asymmetry with a vanishingly small chance of occurring in an isotropic distribution. Astonishingly, regardless of this extreme significance, the observed hemispherical asymmetry for the three distance ranges is aligned with the celestial equator at the 97.1-99.8\% confidence level and with the ecliptic at 94.6-97.6\%, estimated using a Monte Carlo analysis. Shifting \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$} values randomly within their uncertainties has a negligible effect on this result. When a magnitude limit of \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\leq$} 15 mag is applied to these samples, the galaxies within 100 Mpc show no significant anisotropy after randomization of \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}. However, the direction of the asymmetry in the samples within 150 and 200 Mpc and the same magnitude limit is found to be within an angular separation of 32 degrees from (\emph{l,b{$<$}i/{$>$}) = (123.7,24.6) with a 97.2\% and 99.9\% confidence level, respectively. This direction is only 2.6 degrees away from the celestial north pole. Unless the Local Universe has a significant anisotropic distribution of galaxy morphologies aligned with the orientation or the orbit of the Earth (which would be a challenge for the Cosmological Principle), our results show that there seems to be a systematic bias in the classification of galaxy morphological types between the data from the northern and the southern equatorial sky. Further studies are absolutely needed to find the exact source of this anisotropy.}}}}}},

For steel-making section, thermodynamic models of hot metal pretreatment, converter steel-making, secondary refining, and ladle transporting are established to simulate temperature and composition of liquid metal. Energy-saving measures are summarized by analyzing the effects of the operating parameters on energy-consuming process in the section. An integrated scheduling model of slab hot rolling section is established, which concerns the processes of slab transmitting, slab heating, and hot rolling. Production scheduling software and furnace control system are developed. As a result of practical application, the number of rolling units and energy consumption of reheating furnaces are minimized through the systematic optimization. Based on the physical model of dynamic ordered production, simulation platform of production and network model of energy flow are developed for iron and steel manufacturing system.

  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

Our sample consists of 850 galaxies at z{$>$}3 detected in both CANDELS HST imaging and JWST CEERS NIRCam images to enable a comparison of HST and JWST morphologies. Our team conducted a set of visual classifications, with each galaxy in the sample classified by three different individuals. We also measure quantitative morphologies using the publicly available codes across all seven NIRCam filters. Using these measurements, we present the fraction of galaxies of each morphological type as a function of redshift. Overall, we find that galaxies at z{$>$}3 have a wide diversity of morphologies. Galaxies with disks make up a total of 60{\textbackslash}\% of galaxies at z=3 and this fraction drops to {\textasciitilde}30\% at z=6-9, while galaxies with spheroids make up {\textasciitilde}30-40\% across the whole redshift range and pure spheroids with no evidence for disks or irregular features make up {\textasciitilde}20\%. The fraction of galaxies with irregular features is roughly constant at all redshifts ({\textasciitilde}40-50\%), while those that are purely irregular increases from {\textasciitilde}12\% to {\textasciitilde}20\% at z{$>$}4.5. We note that these are apparent fractions as many selection effects impact the visibility of morphological features at high redshift. The distributions of S{\textbackslash}'ersic index, size, and axis ratios show significant differences between the morphological groups. Spheroid Only galaxies have a higher S{\textbackslash}'ersic index, smaller size, and higher axis ratio than Disk/Irregular galaxies. Across all redshifts, smaller spheroid and disk galaxies tend to be rounder. Overall, these trends suggest that galaxies with established disks and spheroids exist across the full redshift range of this study and further work with large samples at higher redshift is needed to quantify when these features first formed.},

To solve the nonlinear planning problem more accurately within an allowable computation time, two phase approach is introduced.

By introducing heuristics into the alternative generation step, infeasible configurations are excluded and this leads to the reduction of the computation time. At the upper level, the optimum configuration is determined using dynamic programming. More reliable and accurate solution that takes into account nonlinear characteristics of the system is obtained and the computation time is greatly reduced by the combination of nonlinear programming (NLP) and heuristics combined dynamic programming.},

  abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 40,000,000 individual classifications made by {\textasciitilde}100,000 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provides a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structual parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour--magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.},

In this paper we present Galaxy Zoo: 3D (GZ: 3D) a crowdsourcing project built on the Zooniverse platform which we used to create spatial pixel (spaxel) maps that identify galaxy centres, foreground stars, galactic bars and spiral arms for 29831 galaxies which were potential targets of the MaNGA survey (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory, part of the fourth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys or SDSS-IV), including nearly all of the 10,010 galaxies ultimately observed. Our crowd-sourced visual identification of asymmetric, internal structures provides valuable insight on the evolutionary role of non-axisymmetric processes that is otherwise lost when MaNGA data cubes are azimuthally averaged. We present the publicly available GZ:3D catalog alongside validation tests and example use cases. These data may in the future provide a useful training set for automated identification of spiral arm features. As an illustration, we use the spiral masks in a sample of 825 galaxies to measure the enhancement of star formation spatially linked to spiral arms, which we measure to be a factor of three over the background disc, and how this enhancement increases with radius.},

In this research, we employ a simulation optimization approach to develop a decision support tool to aid in strategic and operational decision-making. Specifically, we investigate work-in-process inventory levels and potential manufacturing process modifications to reduce utilization costs. A simulation model captures the complex nature of the system while an optimizer searches the solution space and sends trial solutions to the simulation for evaluation. Experimentation suggests that significant daily cost savings are possible by modifying current inventory practices and production process capabilities. Overall, the work demonstrates the ability of the solution approach to analyze complex industrial systems and identify potential improvements in a short time frame.},

  abstract = {Despite showing immense potential as an optimization technique for solving complex industrial problems, the use of evolutionary algorithms, especially genetic algorithms (GAs), is restricted to offline applications in many industrial cases due to their computationally expensive nature. This problem becomes even more severe when the underlying function as well as constraint evaluation is computationally expensive. To reduce the overall application time under this kind of scenario, a combined usage of the original expensive model and a relatively less expensive surrogate model built around the data provided by the original model in the course of optimization has been proposed in this work. Use of surrogates provides the quickness in the application, thereby saving the execution time, and the use of original model allows the optimization tool to be in the right path of the search process. Switching to the surrogate model happens if predictability of the model is of acceptable accuracy (to be decided by the decision maker), and thereby the optimization time is saved without compromising the solution quality. This concept of successive use of surrogate (artificial neural network [ANN]) and original expensive model is applied on an industrial two-layer sintering process where optimization decides the individual thickness and coke content of each layer to maximize sinter quality and minimize coke consumption simultaneously. The use of surrogate could reduce the execution time by 60\% and thereby improve the decision support system utilization without compromising the solution quality.},

However, it is often defined too imprecisely because its multifaceted nature and the sociotechnical structure of AI systems imply a variety of values, practices, and measures to which accountability in AI can refer. We address this lack of clarity by defining accountability in terms of answerability, identifying three conditions of possibility (authority recognition, interrogation, and limitation of power), and an architecture of seven features (context, range, agent, forum, standards, process, and implications). We analyze this architecture through four accountability goals (compliance, report, oversight, and enforcement). We argue that these goals are often complementary and that policy-makers emphasize or prioritize some over others depending on the proactive or reactive use of accountability and the missions of AI governance.},

The photometric redshifts were estimated with an artificial neural network using five ugriz bands, concentration indices and Petrosian radii in the g and r bands. We have explored our redshift estimates with different training sets, thus concluding that the best choice for improving redshift accuracy comprises the main galaxy sample (MGS), the luminous red galaxies and the galaxies of active galactic nuclei covering the redshift range 0 \&lt; z{$\leq$} 0.3. For the MGS, the photometric redshift estimates agree with the spectroscopic values within rms = 0.0227. The distribution of photometric redshifts derived in the range 0 \&lt; zphot{$\leq$} 0.6 agrees well with the model predictions.k-corrections were derived by calibration of the k-correct\_v4.2 code results for the MGS with the reference-frame (z= 0.1) (g-r) colours. We adopt a linear dependence of k-corrections on redshift and (g-r) colours that provide suitable distributions of luminosity and colours for galaxies up to redshift zphot= 0.6 comparable to the results in the literature. Thus, our k-correction estimate procedure is a powerful, low computational time algorithm capable of reproducing suitable results that can be used for testing galaxy properties at intermediate redshifts using the large SDSS data base.},

  abstract = {We investigate the origins of galaxy morphology (defined by bulge-to-total K-band luminosity) in the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmology using two galaxy formation models based on the Millennium Simulation, one by Bower et al. (the Durham model) and the other by De Lucia \&amp; Blaizot [the Max Planck Institut f{\"u}r Astrophysik (MPA) model]. Both models have had considerable success in reproducing a number of observed properties of the local and high-redshift Universe, including star formation rates, the stellar mass function and the luminosity function out to z{$\sim$} 5. There are many similarities, but also fundamental disagreements in the predictions of the two models for galaxy morphology. For example, taking into account uncertainties in the available observational data, both produce a realistic morphological mix today, but its evolution is very different. A main cause of this and other differences is the treatment of disc instabilities which play a more prominent role in the Durham model. Our analysis confirms previous theoretical predictions that elliptical galaxies form most of their stars before the bulk of the galaxy are assembled. Spirals tend to have later `assembly' times than ellipticals as a consequence of in-situ star formation. With the exception of the brightest ellipticals (stellar mass M*{$\greaterequivlnt$} 2.5 {\texttimes} 1011h-1 M{$\odot$}), we find that major mergers are not the primary mechanism by which most spheroids (ellipticals and spiral bulges) assemble their mass. In fact, the majority of ellipticals (and the overwhelming majority of spirals) never experience a major merger (above the resolution limit of our simulation). Most ellipticals and spiral bulges acquire their stellar mass through minor mergers or disc instabilities. These conclusions are common to both the MPA and Durham models. The rotation properties of spheroids may help to constrain the importance of disc instabilities in these models.},

  abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Robodebt was an administratively harmful policy created by bureaucrats incrementally extending existing welfare compliance policies in Australia. This article analyses the long history that created the malign institutional state in which Robodebt was able to occur. It argues the fertile ground for this policy was laid through the historical interplay of three institutional processes: the rules of Commonwealth budget making, the fractured relationship between policy and service delivery in Australian social security, and the structure of the fraud and compliance framework of the Department of Human Services. This created a pattern of institutional change in which compliance policies were added in incremental layers over decades before Robodebt as part of an ongoing drive for savings and operational efficiency. The article concludes by arguing the recommendations of the Royal Commission, which focus on improved legal processes and oversight, are insufficient to resolve the institutional problems at the root of Robodebt. Points for practitioners Robodebt occurred as a result of bureaucrats incrementally extending existing welfare compliance policies, which was a standard annual practice that had been occurring for the preceding 30 years. The expansion of compliance programs was one of the only ways for the Department of Human Services, as the service delivery arm of social security, to meet annual demands from central agencies and politicians to cut expenditure and provide offsets for new spending. For long-term change, the government and the Australian Public Service will need to go further than the recommendations of the Robodebt Royal Commission by addressing the offsetting mechanisms of Commonwealth Budget processes and the structure of the social services portfolio that separates policy and service delivery.},

  abstract = {A surrogate model is a black box model that reproduces the output of another more complex model at a single time point. This is to be distinguished from the method of surrogate data, used in time series. The purpose of a surrogate is to reduce the time necessary for a computation at the cost of rigor and generality. We describe a method of constructing surrogates in the form of support vector machine (SVM) regressions for the purpose of exploring the parameter space of physiological models. Our focus is on the methodology of surrogate creation and accuracy assessment in comparison to the original model. This is done in the context of a simulation of hemorrhage in one model, ``Small'', and renal denervation in another, HumMod. In both cases, the surrogate predicts the drop in mean arterial pressure following the intervention. We asked three questions concerning surrogate models: (1) how many training examples are necessary to obtain an accurate surrogate, (2) is surrogate accuracy homogeneous, and (3) how much can computation time be reduced when using a surrogate. We found the minimum training set size that would guarantee maximal accuracy was widely variable, but could be algorithmically generated. The average error for the pressure response to the protocols was -0.05{\textpm}2.47 in Small, and -0.3 +/- 3.94 mmHg in HumMod. In the Small model, error grew with actual pressure drop, and in HumMod, larger pressure drops were overestimated by the surrogates. Surrogate use resulted in a 6 order of magnitude decrease in computation time. These results suggest surrogate modeling is a valuable tool for generating predictions of an integrative model's behavior on densely sampled subsets of its parameter space.},

We analyze the Near Infrared Spectrograph ERO spectra of three z {$\sim$} 8 galaxies to determine their metallicities, gas temperatures, and ionization. These galaxies offer the first opportunity to understand the physical properties of Epoch-of-Reionization galaxies through detailed rest-optical emission-line spectroscopy. We show that these objects have metal abundances 6.9--8.3, based on both the T e method and on a recent calibration of the R 23 metallicity indicator. Since the spectra are some of the earliest science data from JWST, we compare several line ratios with values expected from robust physics, to validate our measurement procedures. We compare the abundances and emission-line ratios to a nearby sample of Green Pea galaxies---a population of nearby emission-line galaxies whose UV properties resemble Epoch-of-Reionization galaxies, and which often have large Lyman continuum escape fractions. The JWST data show striking further similarities between these high-redshift galaxies and nearby Green Peas. The z {$\sim$} 8 galaxies span the metallicity range covered by Green Peas. They also show the compact morphology that is typical of emission-line-dominated galaxies at all redshifts. Based on these similarities with Green Peas, it is likely that these are the first rest-optical spectra of galaxies that are actively driving cosmological reionization.},

Recent information systems literature has raised concerns regarding ADM's negative unintended consequences, such as widespread discrimination, which in extreme cases can be destructive to society. The extant empirical literature, however, has not sufficiently examined the destructive effects of governmental ADM. In this paper, we report on a case study of the Australian government's ``Robodebt'' programme that was designed to automatically calculate and collect welfare overpayment debts from citizens but ended up causing severe distress to citizens and welfare agency staff. Employing perspectives from systems thinking and organisational limits, we develop a research model that explains how a socially destructive government ADM programme was initiated, sustained, and delegitimized. The model offers a set of generalisable mechanisms that can benefit investigations of ADM's consequences. Our findings contribute to the literature of unintended consequences of ADM and demonstrate to practitioners the importance of setting up robust governance infrastructures for ADM programmes.},

Further, authors are thankful to the European Union for funding this project: SIMUSTEEL (optimization of stocks management and production scheduling by simulation of continuous casting, rolling and finishing department). Contract No. RFSR-CT-2005-00046. Purpose -- The aim of this paper is to propose a simulation study of the ``steel supply chain'' to demonstrate the effect of inventory management and demand variety on the bullwhip effect mitigation. Design/methodology/approach -- The relevant literature is reviewed, and then the simulation model proposed. Findings -- This study identifies reasons for sharing information under varying levels of demand and some variants, and demonstrates the benefits of mitigating the bullwhip effect by applying a design of experiment. It is shown that the information sharing is able to mitigate the bullwhip effect in the steel supply chain by extending the order interval and minimising the order batch size. Research limitations/implications -- This study explores the factors associated with the bullwhip effect. This research is focused on built-to-order simulation, so the results are only oriented on the basis of orders; hence a simultaneous order- and forecast-based steel supply chain should be carried out in the future. Practical implications -- This framework is expected to provide a convenient way to measure the optimum inventory level against a limited level of demand uncertainty, and thus enterprises can promote the supply chain coordination. Originality/value -- An innovative simulation model of the ``steel supply chain'' is proposed, which includes information sharing in the simulation model. Furthermore, dynamic scheduling is shown by applying a continuous ordering and order prioritization rule to replace traditional scheduling methods.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of morphological classification of galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS dataset using classical machine learning techniques. Our approach employs a dimensionality reduction method followed by a classical classifier to categorize galaxies based on shape (cigar/in-between/ round; edge-on/face-on) and texture (smooth/featured). We evaluate various dimensionality reduction methods, including Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), t-SNE, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results demonstrate that most classical classifiers achieve their highest performance when combined with LLE, attaining accuracy comparable to that of simple neural networks. Moreover, in the case of shape classification, the three-dimensional representation remains interpretable, in contrast to the commonly observed loss of interpretability following nonlinear transformations. Additionally, we explore dimensionality reduction followed by k-means clustering to assess whether the data exhibits a natural tendency toward a specific number of clusters. We evaluate clustering performance using silhouette, elbow, Dunn, and Davies--Bouldin scores. While the Davies--Bouldin score indicates a slight preference for four clusters --- closely aligning with classifications made by human astronomers --- the other metrics do not support a distinct clustering structure.},

The growing availability of micro-level data creates challenges for researchers and decision makers in terms of choosing the right level of data aggregation for inference and decisions. Simpson's paradox describes the case where the direction of a causal effect is reversed in the aggregated data compared to the disaggregated data. Detecting whether Simpson's paradox occurs in a dataset used for decision making is therefore critical. This study introduces the use of Classification and Regression Trees for automated detection of potential Simpson's paradoxes in data with few or many potential confounding variables, and even with large samples (big data). Our approach relies on the tree structure and the location of the cause vs. the confounders in the tree. We discuss theoretical and computational aspects of the approach and illustrate it using several real applications in e-governance and healthcare.},

In this paper, based on the time-index variables, we established a mixed integer-programming model for the scheduling problem considering the four performance indexes. Then, the charge splitting policy based on the relaxation of the no confliction and no break cast are proposed. The polynomial dynamic programming algorithm is presented to solve the corresponding relaxed problems. Based on the above approaches, an approximate optimization method with surrogate subgradient algorithm is proposed to solve the relaxed problem. The method has been tested by using practical data from the Shanghai Baoshan steel plant in China. Computational experiments demonstrate that the model and the algorithms developed can generate the satisfactory solutions and realizes rapidly response for the dynamic change.},

  abstract = {Replacement of fossil carbon by renewable biomass-based carbon is an effective measure to mitigate CO2 emission intensity in the blast furnace ironmaking process. Depending on the substitution rate of fossil fuels, the required amount of biomass can be substantial. This raises questions about the availability of biomass for multiple uses. At the same time, the economic competitiveness of biomass-based fuels in ironmaking applications should also be a key consideration. In this assessment, availability of energy wood, i.e., logging residues, small-diameter wood and stumps, in Finland is discussed. Since biomass must be submitted to a thermochemical process before use in a blast furnace, the paper describes the production chain, from biomass to charcoal, and economics related to each processing step. The economics of biomass-based reducing agents is compared to fossil-based ones by taking into account the effect of European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The assessment reveals that there would be sufficient amounts of energy wood available for current users as well as for ironmaking. At present, the economics of biomass-based reducing agents in ironmaking applications is unfavorable. High CO2 emission allowance prices would be required to make such a scheme competitive against fossil-based reducing agents at current fuel prices.},

However, outlier detection through manual monitoring is unfeasible given the volume and velocity of data the sensors produce. Here, we proposed an automated framework that provides early detection of outliers in water-quality data from in situ sensors caused by technical issues.The framework was used first to identify the data features that differentiate outlying instances from typical behaviours. Then statistical transformations were applied to make the outlying instances stand out in transformed data space. Unsupervised outlier scoring techniques were then applied to the transformed data space and an approach based on extreme value theory was used to calculate a threshold for each potential outlier. Using two data sets obtained from in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, Australia, we showed that the proposed framework successfully identified outliers involving abrupt changes in turbidity, conductivity and river level, including sudden spikes, sudden isolated drops and level shifts, while maintaining very low false detection rates. We implemented this framework in the open source R package oddwater.}

At first massive neutrinos were introduced as dark matter, and when this failed to word, cold dark matter (CDM) was introduced. CDM forms early halos, and then baryons eventually fall into these halos. The first CDM computer models of galaxy formation were introduced by Melott and Shandarin and later developed by the ``Gang of Four'' (White, Davis, Efstathiou and Frenk). Eventually, the top-down and bottom-up models gracefully merged, and the concept of ``biasing'' became part of the final model.},

VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic models. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is robustness as opposed to high-resolution histories, and the method is designed to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on the signal-to-noise ratio, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover between two and five stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.},

  abstract = {Currently low reducing agent operation of blast furnace has been actively pursued in ironmaking due to the global warming. The precise and reliable control of blast furnace aiming at the low reducing operation is required to attain smoothly the stable operation. It is considered that the mathematical model on the ironmaking process can play an important role to ensure the stable blast furnace operation. A mathematical model is a powerful tool to improve conventional processes and to design new processes in ironmaking. These tendencies and requirements are common to every country. Thus, the development of advanced mathematical models of blast furnace like DEM (Discrete Element Method) has attracted a special attention in ironmaking field. Moreover, the combined model of DEM with the continuum model is under development for the purpose of the accurate understanding of inner state of blast furnace. In this paper, the recent activity and progress on the development of advanced mathematical model of blast furnace and future perspective for desirable model are described.},

Computational modelling, through high-fidelity simulations, provides a viable approach towards efficient implementation of the design specifications and enhancing our understanding of the system's response. Although high-fidelity modelling provides valuable information the associated computational cost restricts its applicability to full-scaled systems. This chapter presents a Computational Fluid Dynamics optimisation strategy based on surrogate modelling for obtaining high-fidelity predictions of aerodynamic forces and aerodynamic efficiency. An Aerodynamic Shape Optimisation problem is formulated and solved using Genetic Algorithm with surrogate models in the place of actual computational fluid dynamics algorithms. Ordinary Kriging approach and Hammersley Sequence Sampling plan are used to construct the surrogate models.},

Deeper DECaLS images (r~= 23.6 versus r~= 22.2 from SDSS) reveal spiral arms, weak bars, and tidal features not previously visible in SDSS imaging. To best exploit the greater depth of DECaLS images, volunteers select from a new set of answers designed to improve our sensitivity to mergers and bars. Galaxy Zoo volunteers provide 7.5 million individual classifications over 314\,000 galaxies. 140\,000 galaxies receive at least 30 classifications, sufficient to accurately measure detailed morphology like bars, and the remainder receive approximately 5. All classifications are used to train an ensemble of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (a state-of-the-art deep learning method) to predict posteriors for the detailed morphology of all 314\,000 galaxies. We use active learning to focus our volunteer effort on the galaxies which, if labelled, would be most informative for training our ensemble. When measured against confident volunteer classifications, the trained networks are approximately 99~per~cent accurate on every question. Morphology is a fundamental feature of every galaxy; our human and machine classifications are an accurate and detailed resource for understanding how galaxies evolve.},

External and internal system dynamics combined with process unit co-ordination create complex changing circumstances for the enterprise. This paper presents a scoping study as a prelude to enterprise wide considerations at an integrated steelworks to help inform the choice of appropriate model types and optimization techniques. The hierarchical, multi-level structure of the enterprise and the important spatial-temporal scales to consider are defined. Insights into the system were gained by analyzing a large set of dynamic operational data. Over two years of data were subject to both univariate and multivariate analysis with the intent of understanding the complex interrelations of energy flows on site, the inherent system dynamics of the energy network, system operational modes, aspects of planning and scheduling and the coordination between major processing units. This analysis was further used to evaluate the performance of the system in regards to energy utilization and understand the potential economic benefits derived from improved operational decisions.},

Although spectroscopy provides a rich description of the physical processes that govern galaxy evolution, spectroscopic data are observationally expensive to obtain. For the first time, we are able to robustly predict galaxy spectra directly from broad-band imaging. We present a powerful new approach using a hybrid convolutional neural network with deconvolution instead of batch normalization; this hybrid CNN outperforms other models in our tests. The learned mapping between galaxy imaging and spectra will be transformative for future wide-field surveys, such as with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, by multiplying the scientific returns for spectroscopically-limited galaxy samples.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is a tool for building models that accurately represent input training data. When undesired biases concerning demographic groups are in the training data, well-trained models will reflect those biases. We present a framework for mitigating such biases by including a variable for the group of interest and simultaneously learning a predictor and an adversary. The input to the network X, here text or census data, produces a prediction Y, such as an analogy completion or income bracket, while the adversary tries to model a protected variable Z, here gender or zip code. The objective is to maximize the predictor's ability to predict Y while minimizing the adversary's ability to predict Z. Applied to analogy completion, this method results in accurate predictions that exhibit less evidence of stereotyping Z. When applied to a classification task using the UCI Adult (Census) Dataset, it results in a predictive model that does not lose much accuracy while achieving very close to equality of odds (Hardt, et al., 2016). The method is flexible and applicable to multiple definitions of fairness as well as a wide range of gradient-based learning models, including both regression and classification tasks.},

  abstract = {Language is increasingly being used to de-fine rich visual recognition problems with supporting image collections sourced from the web. Structured prediction models are used in these tasks to take advantage of correlations between co-occurring labels and visual input but risk inadvertently encoding social biases found in web corpora. In this work, we study data and models associated with multilabel object classification and visual semantic role labeling. We find that (a) datasets for these tasks contain significant gender bias and (b) models trained on these datasets further amplify existing bias. For example, the activity cooking is over 33\% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained model further amplifies the disparity to 68\% at test time. We propose to inject corpus-level constraints for calibrating existing structured prediction models and design an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation for collective inference. Our method results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5\% and 40.5\% for multilabel classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectively。},
