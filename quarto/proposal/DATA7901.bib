  abstract = {We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as "Green Peas", first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in SDSS imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O III] 5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to {\textasciitilde}1000 A. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8.5 - 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun) with high star formation rates ({\textasciitilde}10 M\_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 {\textasciitilde} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {$<$} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

  abstract = {Classifying the morphologies of galaxies is an important step in understanding their physical properties and evolutionary histories. The advent of large-scale surveys has hastened the need to develop techniques for automated morphological classification. We train and test several convolutional neural network architectures to classify the morphologies of galaxies in both a 3-class (elliptical, lenticular, spiral) and 4-class (+irregular/miscellaneous) schema with a dataset of 14034 visually-classified SDSS images. We develop a new CNN architecture that outperforms existing models in both 3 and 4-way classification, with overall classification accuracies of 83\% and 81\% respectively. We also compare the accuracies of 2-way / binary classifications between all four classes, showing that ellipticals and spirals are most easily distinguished ({$>$}98\% accuracy), while spirals and irregulars are hardest to differentiate (78\% accuracy). Through an analysis of all classified samples, we find tentative evidence that misclassifications are physically meaningful, with lenticulars misclassified as ellipticals tending to be more massive, among other trends. We further combine our binary CNN classifiers to perform a hierarchical classification of samples, obtaining comparable accuracies (81\%) to the direct 3-class CNN, but considerably worse accuracies in the 4-way case (65\%). As an additional verification, we apply our networks to a small sample of Galaxy Zoo images, obtaining accuracies of 92\%, 82\% and 77\% for the binary, 3-way and 4-way classifications respectively.},

  abstract = {Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.},

The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 micorons) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

  abstract = {Studies of galaxy surveys in the context of the cold dark matter paradigm have shown that the mass of the dark matter halo and the total stellar mass are coupled through a function that varies smoothly with mass. Their average ratio M\_\{halo\}/M\_\{stars\} has a minimum of about 30 for galaxies with stellar masses near that of the Milky Way (approximately 5x10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} solar masses) and increases both towards lower masses and towards higher masses. The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies. Here we report the radial velocities of ten luminous globular-cluster-like objects in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2, which has a stellar mass of approximately 2x10{\textasciicircum}8 solar masses. We infer that its velocity dispersion is less than 10.5 kilometers per second with 90 per cent confidence, and we determine from this that its total mass within a radius of 7.6 kiloparsecs is less than 3.4x10{\textasciicircum}8 solar masses. This implies that the ratio M\_\{halo\}/M\_\{stars\} is of order unity (and consistent with zero), a factor of at least 400 lower than expected. NGC1052-DF2 demonstrates that dark matter is not always coupled with baryonic matter on galactic scales.},

Shapley believed that these nebulae were relatively small and lay within the outskirts of the Milky Way galaxy (then thought to be the center or entirety of the universe), while Curtis held that they were in fact independent galaxies, implying that they were exceedingly large and distant. A year later the two sides of the debate were presented and expanded on in independent technical papers under the title "The Scale of the Universe".  In the aftermath of the public debate, scientists have been able to verify individual pieces of evidence from both astronomers, but on the main point of the existence of other galaxies, Curtis has been proven correct.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the morphological and structural properties of a large sample of galaxies at z=3-9 using early JWST CEERS NIRCam observations. Our sample consists of 850 galaxies at z{$>$}3 detected in both CANDELS HST imaging and JWST CEERS NIRCam images to enable a comparison of HST and JWST morphologies. Our team conducted a set of visual classifications, with each galaxy in the sample classified by three different individuals. We also measure quantitative morphologies using the publicly available codes across all seven NIRCam filters. Using these measurements, we present the fraction of galaxies of each morphological type as a function of redshift. Overall, we find that galaxies at z{$>$}3 have a wide diversity of morphologies. Galaxies with disks make up a total of 60{\textbackslash}\% of galaxies at z=3 and this fraction drops to {\textasciitilde}30\% at z=6-9, while galaxies with spheroids make up {\textasciitilde}30-40\% across the whole redshift range and pure spheroids with no evidence for disks or irregular features make up {\textasciitilde}20\%. The fraction of galaxies with irregular features is roughly constant at all redshifts ({\textasciitilde}40-50\%), while those that are purely irregular increases from {\textasciitilde}12\% to {\textasciitilde}20\% at z{$>$}4.5. We note that these are apparent fractions as many selection effects impact the visibility of morphological features at high redshift. The distributions of S{\textbackslash}'ersic index, size, and axis ratios show significant differences between the morphological groups. Spheroid Only galaxies have a higher S{\textbackslash}'ersic index, smaller size, and higher axis ratio than Disk/Irregular galaxies. Across all redshifts, smaller spheroid and disk galaxies tend to be rounder. Overall, these trends suggest that galaxies with established disks and spheroids exist across the full redshift range of this study and further work with large samples at higher redshift is needed to quantify when these features first formed.},

  abstract = {Morphology is a powerful indicator of a galaxy's dynamical and merger history. It is strongly correlated with many physical parameters, including mass, star formation history and the distribution of mass. The Galaxy Zoo project collected simple morphological classifications of nearly 900,000 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, contributed by hundreds of thousands of volunteers. This large number of classifications allows us to exclude classifier error, and measure the influence of subtle biases inherent in morphological classification. This paper presents the data collected by the project, alongside measures of classification accuracy and bias. The data are now publicly available and full catalogues can be downloaded in electronic format from http://data.galaxyzoo.org.},

  abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 40,000,000 individual classifications made by {\textasciitilde}100,000 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provides a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structual parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour--magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.},

  abstract = {The challenge of consistent identification of internal structure in galaxies - in particular disc galaxy components like spiral arms, bars, and bulges - has hindered our ability to study the physical impact of such structure across large samples. In this paper we present Galaxy Zoo: 3D (GZ: 3D) a crowdsourcing project built on the Zooniverse platform which we used to create spatial pixel (spaxel) maps that identify galaxy centres, foreground stars, galactic bars and spiral arms for 29831 galaxies which were potential targets of the MaNGA survey (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory, part of the fourth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys or SDSS-IV), including nearly all of the 10,010 galaxies ultimately observed. Our crowd-sourced visual identification of asymmetric, internal structures provides valuable insight on the evolutionary role of non-axisymmetric processes that is otherwise lost when MaNGA data cubes are azimuthally averaged. We present the publicly available GZ:3D catalog alongside validation tests and example use cases. These data may in the future provide a useful training set for automated identification of spiral arm features. As an illustration, we use the spiral masks in a sample of 825 galaxies to measure the enhancement of star formation spatially linked to spiral arms, which we measure to be a factor of three over the background disc, and how this enhancement increases with radius.},

  abstract = {We investigate the origins of galaxy morphology (defined by bulge-to-total K-band luminosity) in the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmology using two galaxy formation models based on the Millennium Simulation, one by Bower et al. (the Durham model) and the other by De Lucia \&amp; Blaizot [the Max Planck Institut f{\"u}r Astrophysik (MPA) model]. Both models have had considerable success in reproducing a number of observed properties of the local and high-redshift Universe, including star formation rates, the stellar mass function and the luminosity function out to z{$\sim$} 5. There are many similarities, but also fundamental disagreements in the predictions of the two models for galaxy morphology. For example, taking into account uncertainties in the available observational data, both produce a realistic morphological mix today, but its evolution is very different. A main cause of this and other differences is the treatment of disc instabilities which play a more prominent role in the Durham model. Our analysis confirms previous theoretical predictions that elliptical galaxies form most of their stars before the bulk of the galaxy are assembled. Spirals tend to have later `assembly' times than ellipticals as a consequence of in-situ star formation. With the exception of the brightest ellipticals (stellar mass M*{$\greaterequivlnt$} 2.5 {\texttimes} 1011h-1 M{$\odot$}), we find that major mergers are not the primary mechanism by which most spheroids (ellipticals and spiral bulges) assemble their mass. In fact, the majority of ellipticals (and the overwhelming majority of spirals) never experience a major merger (above the resolution limit of our simulation). Most ellipticals and spiral bulges acquire their stellar mass through minor mergers or disc instabilities. These conclusions are common to both the MPA and Durham models. The rotation properties of spheroids may help to constrain the importance of disc instabilities in these models.},

We analyze the Near Infrared Spectrograph ERO spectra of three z {$\sim$} 8 galaxies to determine their metallicities, gas temperatures, and ionization. These galaxies offer the first opportunity to understand the physical properties of Epoch-of-Reionization galaxies through detailed rest-optical emission-line spectroscopy. We show that these objects have metal abundances 6.9--8.3, based on both the T e method and on a recent calibration of the R 23 metallicity indicator. Since the spectra are some of the earliest science data from JWST, we compare several line ratios with values expected from robust physics, to validate our measurement procedures. We compare the abundances and emission-line ratios to a nearby sample of Green Pea galaxies---a population of nearby emission-line galaxies whose UV properties resemble Epoch-of-Reionization galaxies, and which often have large Lyman continuum escape fractions. The JWST data show striking further similarities between these high-redshift galaxies and nearby Green Peas. The z {$\sim$} 8 galaxies span the metallicity range covered by Green Peas. They also show the compact morphology that is typical of emission-line-dominated galaxies at all redshifts. Based on these similarities with Green Peas, it is likely that these are the first rest-optical spectra of galaxies that are actively driving cosmological reionization.},

At first, dark matter was not part of either model, but this effort to explain the origin of galaxies eventually stalled for both models the because the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation are too small to accommodate galaxy formation from baryons alone. At first massive neutrinos were introduced as dark matter, and when this failed to word, cold dark matter (CDM) was introduced. CDM forms early halos, and then baryons eventually fall into these halos. The first CDM computer models of galaxy formation were introduced by Melott and Shandarin and later developed by the ``Gang of Four'' (White, Davis, Efstathiou and Frenk). Eventually, the top-down and bottom-up models gracefully merged, and the concept of ``biasing'' became part of the final model.},

Deeper DECaLS images (r~= 23.6 versus r~= 22.2 from SDSS) reveal spiral arms, weak bars, and tidal features not previously visible in SDSS imaging. To best exploit the greater depth of DECaLS images, volunteers select from a new set of answers designed to improve our sensitivity to mergers and bars. Galaxy Zoo volunteers provide 7.5 million individual classifications over 314\,000 galaxies. 140\,000 galaxies receive at least 30 classifications, sufficient to accurately measure detailed morphology like bars, and the remainder receive approximately 5. All classifications are used to train an ensemble of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (a state-of-the-art deep learning method) to predict posteriors for the detailed morphology of all 314\,000 galaxies. We use active learning to focus our volunteer effort on the galaxies which, if labelled, would be most informative for training our ensemble. When measured against confident volunteer classifications, the trained networks are approximately 99~per~cent accurate on every question. Morphology is a fundamental feature of every galaxy; our human and machine classifications are an accurate and detailed resource for understanding how galaxies evolve.},
